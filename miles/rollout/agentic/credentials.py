"""Sandbox-provider credentials and endpoints for agent-function launchers.

The contract every sandbox backend shares: rollout workers read a provider
credential from their own environment or from a key file; the launcher
forwards only the file PATH (never the value, which would ride ray's
runtime_env in plaintext) and address-like variables by value.

PROVIDER_CREDENTIALS holds one entry per backend in
openenv_sandbox_common.AGENT_MODULES; a provider is added there, not by
growing a branch:

  key_env_vars   what a worker must ALL have for the env-supply path to work
                 (Modal's credential is a token PAIR, not one key)
  file_env_var   the path-valued var the launcher forwards instead of secrets
  forward        addresses/selectors, safe to forward by value
  target         (var, label, default description) echoed so a launch says
                 which endpoint/environment it will actually use
